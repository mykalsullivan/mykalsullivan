# Sup, nerd. My name is Mykal Sullivan.

I'm a current student at Arkansas State University - Beebe enrolled in fall 2022 for the computer information systems, mathematics, and general studies associate's programs. Once I finish ASUB, I plan to transfer to University of Arkansas at Little Rock to pursue their c.s. game programming and math programs and minor in cybersecurity. Currently, I'm employed as an IT help desk technician at ASUB and was previously a math/business/c.s. tutor for the TRIO Student Support Services/Upward Bound programs.
I'm mainly focused on earning my degrees at ASUB and earning as many certifications possible... all while honing in on my programming skills in the meantime!
